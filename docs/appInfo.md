# App Info

Create `appInfo.json` beside the main `.py` file. The `json` file contains the app settings. 

**This option will be activated in the next version**

**appInfo.json**
```
{
    "name": <app name>,
    "version": <app version>,
    "description": "",
    "author": "",
    "license": ""
}
```

The title of `alert box` or any thing that requires the **name** of the app will be the name from `appInfo.json` file.
